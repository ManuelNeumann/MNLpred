Description: Functions to easily return simulated predicted probabilities and
    first differences for multinomial logit models. It takes a specified 
    scenario and a multinom model to predict probabilities with a set of
    coefficients, drawn from a simulated sampling distribution. The simulated 
    predictions allow for meaningful plots with means and confidence intervals.
