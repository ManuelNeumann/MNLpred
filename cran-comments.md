## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have addressed:

* Including a reference to the  paper the method is based on in the description.
* Exchanging \dontrun with \donttest

## Test environments

* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit (on rhub)
* OS Catalina 10.15, R 3.6.1
* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC (on rhub)
* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran (on rhub)


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There is one NOTE:

Maintainer: 'Manuel Neumann <manuel.neumann@mzes.uni-mannheim.de>'
  
  
  New submission
  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    Tomz (15:5)
    Wittenberg (15:15)
  Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
  
    DOI: 10.2307/2669316
      From: DESCRIPTION
      Status: Forbidden
      Message: 403

* Mis-spelled words are the names of authors.
* DOI is correct, but article is behind a pay-wall.
